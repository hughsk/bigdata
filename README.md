# bigdata #

A work-in-progress attempt at visualising various metrics for every package in
NPM interactively in the browser. Data retrieval, cleaning and querying is
implemented and just needs frontend work now.

Putting this here to make sure I get this finished soon, or in the case I
never get round to it the code is available for pillaging :)
